# 🧠 Java Lambdas Practice – S1.08_Lambdas_LV1

## 📄 Description - Exercise Overview

This project contains a series of **8 Java exercises** focused on practicing **lambdas and functional programming** using Java 8+.
It covers practical use cases such as filtering lists, sorting data, method references, and creating functional interfaces.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Java 8 or higher
- IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
- Stream API
- Functional Interfaces
- Git & GitHub

## 📋 Requirements

- JDK 8 or later installed
- IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- Basic understanding of Java syntax

## 🛠️ Installation

   git clone https://github.com/anaberod/S1.08_Lambdas_LV1.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Ensure Java 8+ is set as the project SDK.

## ▶️ Execution

- Run each exercise individually from its main method.

## 📘 Exercise List

### 🔹 Exercise 1
Filter a list of Strings to return only those that contain the letter 'o'.

### 🔹 Exercise 2
Filter Strings that contain 'o' **and** are longer than 5 characters.

### 🔹 Exercise 3
Create a list with the names of the months. Print them using a lambda expression.

### 🔹 Exercise 4
Do the same as Exercise 3, but use **method reference** instead of a lambda.

### 🔹 Exercise 5
Create a Functional Interface with a method `getPiValue()` that returns `3.1415` using a lambda.

### 🔹 Exercise 6
Create a mixed list of numbers and Strings. Sort them by the **length** of each element (as text), from shortest to longest.

### 🔹 Exercise 7
Sort the same list as in Exercise 6, but from **longest to shortest**.

### 🔹 Exercise 8
Create a Functional Interface with a method `reverse(String s)`. Use a lambda to return the reversed string.
